# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run build` - Build the application (always run this to ensure everything is working)
- `npm run lint` - Lint the codebase with ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview the built application
- `npm run dev` - Development server (don't run this, user runs it themselves)

## Architecture

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite application that processes files using Google's Gemini AI. The app allows users to upload multiple files and process them in parallel with custom instructions.

### Key Components Architecture

- **App.tsx** - Main component that conditionally renders single-file vs multi-file layouts
- **FileUpload** - Handles file selection and validation (up to 10 files, text files only)
- **InstructionsPanel** - Contains instruction input and process/clear controls
- **ResponseDisplay** - Shows AI response for single file processing
- **MultiFileResponseDisplay** - Shows AI responses for multiple files in parallel

### Data Flow

1. Files are managed in App.tsx state and passed down to components
2. `useAIProcessor` hook manages file processing state and coordinates parallel AI calls
3. `aiService.ts` handles the actual Gemini API integration using AI SDK
4. Results stream back in real-time via the `onChunk` callback pattern

### File Processing System

The app processes files in parallel using Promise.all:
- Each file gets its own FileResult with processing state
- Streaming responses update the UI in real-time
- Error handling is per-file, allowing partial success

### Tech Stack

- **UI**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **Build**: Vite with path aliases (`@/` â†’ `./src/`)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/google`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with Radix UI primitives

### Environment

Requires `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable for Gemini API access.

## Development Notes

- Use context7 to look up documentation for all packages
- Don't run the dev server or preview (user runs it themselves)
- Use browser MCP for debugging browser issues
- Only stage changes when explicitly requested
- Only commit when explicitly requested
- Always run build to ensure everything is working fine

- when i say look at the browser, i mean the tab is already loaded with the page. don't navigate there
